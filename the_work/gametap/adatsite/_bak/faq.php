Should I see a doctor?</b><br>          There is a slight chance you need glasses, but it is more likely that you have severe 3rd Dimensia and should contact your physician as soon as possible. You could be a danger to everyone.            <p><b>What do patients eat during treatment at the Institute?</b><br>              As often as possible, we make sure to stay away from 2D foods like pancakes and fruit leather. Instead we focus on the most 3 Dimensional foods on the market. Whole turkeys and watermelons are especially good for ADAD patients.</p>            <p><b>Are there different treatments for male and female patients?</b><br>        Back in the early days of ADAD, there were very different treatments depending on your gender. Men sat in steam-boxes for hours on end and women operated looms. Today, men and women are given the exact same treatment.</p></td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td>        <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td>        <td valign="top" class="bodyCopyGray">&nbsp;</td>      </tr>    </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td><img src="images/bottom_line.gif" width="799" height="26"></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
