Many people ignore these symptoms or  mistake them for other, more popular disorders.  Left undiagnosed,  3rd Dimensia can cause serious damage to you, your life, and your home.<br><br>    Up until the early 1990s, it was commonly thought that 3rd Dimensia was only a disorder for patients dealing with 2-to-3-dimensional crossover.  But today, scientists and doctors know better.  Be warned: 3rd Dimensia does not discriminate.  It can strike anyone at anytime.  </td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td>      </tr>    </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td><img src="images/bottom_line.gif" width="799" height="26"></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
