As a major part of the Department of Gameland Security, Gameland Astrospace and Defense puts a major emphasis on asteroid, alien, and space-missile detection and intervention. Astrospace and Defense is Gameland's first and best line of defense against any civilizations or menaces eager to destroy the Gameland and her way of life.</p>			<h3>Department of the Navy<br />			Admiral Deacon Koble</h3>			<p>The Department of the Navy (formerly Water Affairs) provides the waters of Gameland with the vital gunship protection necessary in this dangerous age of pirates and sea monsters.  By merging high security and diplomacy on the high seas, the Department of the Navy has been able to keep the waters of Gameland safe for over 75 years.</p>			<h3>Sky Protection Authority<br />			Carmine G Theurer - Director</h3>			<p>Securing the skies over Gameland may seem like a daunting and dramatic mission with no hope of success, but the Sky Protection Authority is making this mission a success.  Gameland's airspace takes up over 3.5 million square miles and may contain up to 1000 flying machines at one time.  It's because of this reason that the Sky Protection Authority only recruits the top men in the field.  The Sky Protection Authority is always on patrol and will always be there to protect you from sky danger.</p>			<h3>Monster/Insect Control<br />			Devlin S Warshaw - Director</h3>			<p>Monsterism is a serious threat, which has held the nation's collective consciousness hostage for the past several years.  With the overwhelming amount of monsters and giant space insects that have invaded our soil since last fall, Gameland Security decided it was vital to have an agency specifically designated to manage and sometimes get rid of these strange entities and so the department of Monster/Insect Control was created. Monster/Insect Control is a two-pronged organization.  First, they oversee the welcoming of monsters and space insects into Gameland, and second, they administer any deportation/destruction deemed necessary by Director Warshaw.  By keeping a close eye on monsters and space insects, Monster/Insect Control helps us all sleep a little better at night.</p>			<h3>Gameland Intelligence Division<br />			Warren Alcorn - Director</h3>			<p>The Gameland Intelligence Division was created in 1985 to protect Gameland from unseen, unknown, and vague dangers. Made up of agents whose top qualities include integrity, courage, and skagility, the Gameland Intelligence Division is among the best information divisions in the universe.  By collecting information, providing in-depth analysis and conducting superstealth missions, the Gameland Intelligence Division ensures the security of the land and its people.</p>		</div>	</div></div></div></body></html>
