	<p><strong>Tank Granite</strong> - Sure Tank's a legend, but he still gets his hands dirty every day by teaching the advanced students how to get as Goatz as they can.  Tank has three degrees in Xtremity and one honorarium from Bit City College.</p>

	<p><strong>Russell B.</strong> - You don't need a full last name when you are the best in the biz.  Russell B. has been teaching hiding for over 8 years and loves what he does.  Nobody knows where he learned his trade, but when you're as good as Russell is, accreditations don't matter! </p>

	<p><strong>Janis Coppermiser</strong> - Teaching Xtreme 101 takes a soft touch, and no touch is softer than Janis Coppermiser's.  She knows how to work with wide-eyed young students and show them everything their fragile minds need to know to become the best jumpers, duckers, and hiders in the field.  Janis written several books on the subject, including her recent best seller "And We Will Keep Climbing It:  A True Story."</p>

	<p><strong>TJ Keen</strong> - TJ is a prodigy in the field of Platform Jumping as well as one of Tank's most talented alums.  He entered XPJS at 13 and graduated within two years.  TJ loves teaching and never tires of getting up on the platforms to show the class how jumps get jumped.  He plans to release a CD in the fall of 2006</p>

	<p><strong>Alex Kidd</strong> - One of our students' favorite substitute teachers, Alex Kidd has years of professional experience jumping in a lot of different worlds.  Alex is all about technique and reminding students that jumping can be a good time as well as a serious way to move.  Alex loves hamburgers and onigiri.</p>

	<p><strong>Rory Placid</strong> - Rory comes to us from MasterSys Technical College where he taught ladder building.  When Rory teaches, he not only explains the science of climbing, but he also explains the engineering behind the ladders themselves.  This method is not taught at any other school.</p>

	<p><strong>Rastan</strong> - A lifetime of battle has taught Rastan one very important lesson - ducking saves lives.  In the field of battle, a well-placed duck and stab can mean one less enemy to deal with.  But Rastan doesn't teach killing.  No, when he's subbing at XPJS, he's got one thing on his mind - ducking.  </p>

	<p><strong>Dr. Shinobi</strong> - Dr. Shinobi is part of an exchange program for professors and comes to us from Japan University for Ninja.  The Doc is the resident ducking expert at JUN and brings a lot of excellent experience to our little school.  We're grateful to have him around.</p>
