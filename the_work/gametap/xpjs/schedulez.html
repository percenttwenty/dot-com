			<h1>Xtreme 101 - Survey of Xtremity:</h1>
			<p>This 'hands-off' course was created to let students investigate the most fundamental Xtreme subjects in the known universe.  Xtreme 101 focuses on the three most important areas of Xtreme Movement: Platform Jumping, Ladders, and Ducking.  Through lectures, demonstrations, puppetry, and the occasional guest lecture, students will be able to gain a better understanding of what goes into being Xtreme in today's world.<br><em>Instructor:  Janis Coppermiser</em></p>
			<h1><strike>Ducking 242 - Ducking for Duckers</strike> <span class="cancelled">CANCELLED</span></h1>
			<p>In this mid-level course students will learn about ducking and what exactly should be ducked in the physical realm.  Students will also discover when to duck, when not to duck, what actions constitute ducking and what actions do not.  A basic understanding of stealth and evasion is a must for this class. Instructor may take the class on field trips to look at walls and underbrush.<br><em>Instructor:  Dr Shinobi</em></p>
			<h1><strike>Ladders 326 - The Second Rung</strike> <span class="cancelled">CANCELLED</span></h1>  		
			<p>Intermediate Ladder courses typically focus on theory without letting students ever really find out what it's like to climb up or down.  Ladders 326 takes a different approach and teaches the class laddering by putting students into the heart of the action.  Moving up, climbing down, jumping on to, leaping from, and top-mounting will all be covered in the course.  Students are expected to actively participate in this course and they must not have a fear of ladders. <br><em>Instructor:  Rory Placid</em></p>
			<h1><strike>Platform Jumping 359 - Jump Ahoy</strike> <span class="cancelled">CANCELLED</span></h1>
			<p>For those who aim to jump at a professional level, Platform Jumping 359 is a must.  Students will be led through a series of different jump scenarios in a jump simulator (the Jump-U-Later 2000) and then taken to the proving grounds where they will be expected to master jumps at low and medium heights.  Once the students have properly demonstrated the necessary skills, they will need to deliver a 10-minute oral presentation to to XPJS founder Tank Granite on the virtues of Platform Jumping.<br><em>Instructor:  TJ Keen</em></p>
