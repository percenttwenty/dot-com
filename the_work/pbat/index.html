				<p>A friend and I were approached by the Taproot Foundation in early 2009, with a request to make a site for their Pro Bono Action Tank (PBAT). The Taproot Foundation is a well-regarded nonprofit, with the mission of connecting corporate pro bono efforts with needy organizations. Our job was to capture the wide range of industries where they've had success, and to put a professional, exciting front on their work.</p>
				<p>Since this was a two-person freelance job, we did everything. We conducted stakeholder interviews, presented rounds of design, managed the clients, and built some pretty nice stuff.</p>
				<p>To keep costs as low as possible, we tried to use free software as much as possible. The site was built on top of WordPress. Photo galleries were handled with Flickr and a couple slideshow plugins. And a major priority was the case study section, featuring work from all over the world, built with XML and a pretty involved Google Maps integration.</p>
				<p>Sadly, our site was folded into <a href="http://www.taprootfoundation.org/" target="_blank">their primary site</a> a year or two ago. I dug up a couple pre-templated pages from my archives, though you should note that they're not the finished versions. Here's the <a href="build/home.html" target="_blank">home page</a> and <a href="build/resources.html" target="_blank">resources landing page</a>.</p>
