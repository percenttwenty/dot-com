			<p>I got married in July of 2010. Rather than hiring a wedding planner and going the easy way, my wife and I treated the wedding as an exciting creative opportunity. Naturally, it was more work than expected, but all the effort added up to something that felt intensely personal and fun.</p>
			<p>The fun started with a series of teaser photos. Using my trusty Holga medium-format camera, we shot a couple rolls around Boston, equipped with a blackboard that featured our site URL. These simple photos went out to our guests and acted as our "save the date" cards, and led everyone to our site.</p>
			<p>I enlisted the help of a designer friend and built a site that utilized soft colors and physical textures (lace, burlap) alongside beautiful typography and a Happy Cog-esque combination opening sentence/navigation. The site evolved alongside the planning, of which we blogged each step. I built a simple PHP-powered RSVP mechanism to capture our guest list, and when the wedding was over, launched a "Thank You!" site that featured downloadable playlists of wedding music and photos.</p>
			<p>And there were plenty of mini-projects that tied everything together. We hired a friend's big band to perform, so we custom-printed <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grenade/4846165025/in/set-72157624391573011/" target="_blank">tickets for our guests</a>, complete with seating assignments for the night. In order to fit our guests into the room, I built <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grenade/4843006428/in/set-72157624391573011" target="_blank">nine different seating chart variations</a> in Google Sketchup. We brought my friend and bandmate Alex Chen in to design a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grenade/4846167223/in/set-72157624391573011/" target="_blank">beautiful rock poster</a>. I made my print design debut, creating <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grenade/4847120521/in/set-72157624391573011/" target="_blank">programs</a> with elements from the website identity. For months, I shot photos of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grenade/4847121009/in/set-72157624391573011/">every number between 1-15 I could find</a>, using the prints as table markings for the event. I even rehearsed with the big band and sat in for a chart with my brother and sister.</p>
