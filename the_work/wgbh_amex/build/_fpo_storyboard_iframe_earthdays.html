    My boyfriend and I took part in the 1970 Earth Day demonstrations in Manhattan.   Back then we self-advertised with buttons instead of T-shirts.  My boyfriend, Vinny, came up with a button that read, "Earth Control", a play on the then popular movement of "birth control."   I was astounded to see Vinny's 1970 self in the "Earth Days" documentary.  Between 1966 and 1972 I was in Manhattan almost every day.  Upon arriving home at night, I would wipe the soot off of my face with alcohol pads.  The pads would be black with soot and it took several to clean my face.  Foolishly, I bought a white coat and wore it into Manhattan.  By the end of the day, it was a light grey color.  In 1982, I moved to Florida.  Ahhhh, clean air!  In the 1990's I made a few trips to Manhattan and was delighted to find there was no soot on my face at the end of the day!  I tell that simple story because it illustrates what was accomplished through the Earth Day movement which encouraged President Nixon to sign a bill creating the Environmental Protection Agency.  A Clean Water Act followed.  Our lakes and streams are much cleaner than they were in 1970.   And it is because people in this country believed they could make a difference and came together to get it done.

    I was only 3 and a 1/2 years old on the first Earth Day, but my mum had me on the side of the county road we live off of, a hefty bag in hand, picking up litter. I remember asking my mum 2 questions: What were we doing? She replied we were "Helping clean Mother Earth"; Why were we the only people doing it? (FYI - It was once a 1 lane each way road and bust back then & is now a 2 lane 'speedway')"Because it was the first Earth Day and WE were doing something honor of the day, even if no one else was". Well that sure stuck with me. We never celebrated again BUT my mum (who must have had flower child tendencies I now joke)planted a seed - that in recent years has blossomed. I try my best to make every day Earth Day to the best of my abilities. I still have a long way to go - but it's something to aspire to. Happy Earth Day!

    I remember awaking at 5 a.m. to join Sue-Ellen Panitch and students at the local dump to do recycling. It was so cold that we had to wear insulated underwear, boots and gloves. We took aluminum to recycle and always had a steady stream of customers each month unless the snow was too heavy. This was about 1972 or 1973, and I still remember how proud I felt to be doing something about the environment. Today I am teaching my students about Earth Day and leading them in a project on reducing their environmental footprints. We are celebrating the 40th anniversary with a "waste walk" around the school and doing an inventory of how the school could become greener.

    A few weeks after April 22, 1970 I arrived back in D.C., where I had gone to law school, from New York.  I was looking for a job in 'public interest law', a new field.  I was directed by Ralph Nader's office to the Environmental Law Institute in the Dupont Circle Building. I walked in and was immediately impressed with the enthusiasm of the small group forming ELI and preparing to publish the Environmental Law Reporter. I was told it was a shame I had missed "Earth Day", of which frankly I had been only vaguely aware. I was offered the position of Assistant Editor, which I accepted gladly. I quickly became very impressed, awe struck really, with the talent, dedication and good cheer of the people I met working to 'protect the environment'. I have been working in the field of environmental law and policy one way or another ever since and regretted nothing except my missing the first Earth Day.

    Thank you for the great special on Earth Day and the environmental and ecology movements.  I was almost 14 on earth day in 1970 and I don't remember much about that day.  <br/><br/>But my comment is about the revival of the Earth Day Ecology Symbol and the artist Ron Cobb that created the first ecology symbol.  We need to bring that symbol back!<br/><br/>This link has some history <a href="http://www.ecologysymbol.com/">http://www.ecologysymbol.com</a>. His current web site is <a href="http://roncobb.net/">http://roncobb.net</a>. Both the peace symbol and the ecology symbol were developed / popularized around 1969....<br/><br/>It would be great to revive the Ecology Symbol and give it's place in history with Earth Day.  The symbol is in the public domain. <a href="http://roncobb.net/category/cartoons/environmental/">http://roncobb.net/category/cartoons/environmental</a>. <br/><br/>We must all have a sustainable approach to life.

    I was only 10 for the first Earth Day. I rode my bike to school that day instead of riding the bus. I tried to live my life and be environmentally friendly. I only live in a house that is 1200 sq ft. I bought my house that was already 3 years old instead of build on a piece of land. I have recycled since 1986 when I bought my home, and compost. It seems you wanted to blame the WW2 generation for all the problems of the world when in fact it is the generation that created Earth Day. I think the environment is important but your program focused on how bad industry has been and not how our generation needs bigger houses, bigger cars, etc.

    I had to drive from Houston, TX, to Baton Rouge, LA, on the first Earth Day in 1970. A national Earth Day PR campaign encouraged Earth Day supporters to drive with their car lights on. I was proud to play a small part in the first Earth Day event by driving the entire day with my car lights on. I was encouraged and enthused to see that so many other folks were also driving with their lights on. People did not drive with their lights on in 1970 as they do now, so it was easy to judge the support for Earth Day.  Although my effort and contribution to the first Earth Day was simple, it was an emotional experience for me, as it still is as I think back on it. I am unsettled as I think about what we have left for our children, how much further we have slid since 1970 without implementing the technology and adopting behavior that preserves our resources and environment, and what we have done to our reputation in the eyes of the rest of the world because of our behavior in the areas of resource utilization and environmental impact. The intelligence, enlightenment, vision, technology and desire exists in our nation; we must move forward, outperform the obstructionists and educate the reluctant and less informed.

    I was a sophomore in high school when the first Earth Day occurred.  It expanded my awareness of many issues, and I read the books that were emerging during this time.  During my junior year,  I read The Population Bomb by Paul Ehrlich, and gave a talk about it to my English class.  In the talk, I announced that I had decided not to have children.  Afterward, my teacher  said "you'll change your mind."  Although I've been a step-parent, I never had children of my own, and I don't regret it.  Thanks, Paul!

    I was active in the Earth Day movement during the 1970s and I'm still active forty years later.  Much has been accomplished by environmentalists during the last four decades.   However, there are moments when we seem to be spinning our wheels in the mud.   It's significant that the public's interest in global warming has actually declined during the last two years, despite all of the movies, lectures, and demonstrations....  I'm concerned, also, about some of the cozy relationships that have developed between the big environmental protection organizations and the big chemical and energy companies....  What next for the environmentalists?   The "environmental justice" movement - with its emphasis on racial and economic justice - is significant.   It's significant, also, that a variety of religious organizations are now involved with environmental concerns.   These are new developments that need to be acknowledged.    The environmental protection movement in the next ten, twenty, and thirty years will be very different from the environmental protection movement that we've seen in recent years.   We're way past the Woodstock era and we're moving towards something new.

    Just saw myself next to Denis Hayes and Arturo Sandoval (I am standing in a white shirt) in an interview in the Teach-in offices at Dupont circle in D.C., plunked down into Stone's movie. Saw the only black man in our group "Moose" in the next frame. Old home week for sure.

    As I sit here watching Earth Days on PBS - I am reminded of the first time I ever heard of Earth Day.  Sitting in Mr. Michael Acresti's 5th grade science class in Canton, PA I was hooked.  Mr. Acresti was probably fresh out of college and probably was one of those college students that participated in the first Earth Day in 1970.  I don't remember what he said but the desire to protect this Earth was born in me at that time, and if I could find him I would thank him.  I went home and immediately started to try cleaning up where I lived, my mother wanted to know what all this garbage was and why I was bringing it home.  Thank you Mr. Acresti...

    I was at the first Earth Day at UC Davis in 1970. I recall an art teacher speaking about the beauty of the earth; a genetics professor spoke to the need to restore the planet and ensure that species could flourish. Our university president also spoke about how universities needed to show the way and do all it could to be good stewards. It certainly was festive - loads of signs, people wearing tie-dyed clothing. Music everywhere.

    I was a sophomore in high school and I don't recall knowing that April 22, 1970 was called Earth Day nor that it was the first Earth Day.  Perhaps what I am about to say took place two days later on the 24th.  I say that because it seems like it was a Friday, the day before I had a cast put on my left leg because I had Osgood-Schlatters disease and I know that Saturday was the day that the cast went on.  What I do remember is my small high school in Northern Maine had no classes in the afternoon, but instead each of the four classes had designated roads to walk and pick up trash.  As I recall, it started out on the sunny side, but then ended up raining before it was over.  Some of the students in my class had the Walker Road assignment.  As I remember, I took the job of picking up litter rather seriously and my reward for doing so was finding a ten-dollar bill.  Minimum wage back then was $1.60 so my findings equaled 6.25 hours of wages!

    I remember that first Earth Day celebration on Boston Common in 1970, on that hill facing the Public Gardens.<br/><br/>I remember it because, at that time there were two to three anti-war demos a week on the Common, that would draw 50-100k each. I was very surprised by the 50k+ drawn by this new "Ecology" movement !

    As a high school senior I produced a speakers assembly at Henry Grady High in Atlanta to introduce the concept of Ecology. I found volunteer speakers from nearby colleges, Georgia Tech, Emory, and Georgia State U. who were professors in the fields of science/biology.  The concept of the world as one ecosystem was brand new and very mind-altering. I realized that all living things were interdependent and each of us make an impact on our environment. This reinforced "global thinking" as a headset for the rest of my life. This way of thinking was new as the concept of the internet giving us our current sense of connectedness didn't exist .

    I was a sophomore biology major at Hartwick College, attended a number of "teach-ins" and went fly fishing that afternoon with some ADO Fraternity brothers. Had fresh trout for dinner. Well, 40 years later I have that biology degree, added a MS degree in aquatic ecology, worked as an environmental toxicologist, got a Master of Library Science Degree at Syracuse University and have spent the past 28 years as an environmental librarian/information specialist.
